# ⭐️ The vision

You shall be able to add a powerful feature flag tooling to your own
infrastructure/tech stack. To build your own. With low costs. And low effort.

# 🤩 Say hello to

- 🤑 Low costs
- 🔐 PII sensitive tooling
- ⚡️ Low latency
- 💻 Intuitive management UI
- 📶 No third party service outages

# 👋 Say goodbye to

- 💸 High costs.
- 👩 PII data leaving your system.
- ⏳ High latency due to calls to third parties.
- 🖥️ Unintuitive management UIs.
- 🚨 Third party service outages.

# 🏗️ Projects
